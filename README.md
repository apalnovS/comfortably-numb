# The wall


Is there anybody in there?<br/>
Just nod if you can hear me<br/>
Is there anyone home?<br/>
Come on now<br/>
<br/>
I hear you're feeling down<br/>
Well I can ease your pain<br/>
Get you on your feet again<br/>
Relax<br/>
<br/>
I'll need some information first<br/>
Just the basic facts<br/>
Can you show me where it hurts?<br/>
There is no pain you are receding<br/>
<br/>
A distant ship smoke on the horizon<br/>
You are only coming through in waves<br/>
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br/>
When I was a child I had a fever<br/>
<br/>
My hands felt just like two balloons<br/>
Now I've got that feeling once again<br/>
I can't explain you would not understand<br/>
This is not how I am<br/>
<br/>
I have become comfortably numb<br/>
I have become comfortably numb<br/>
<br/>
Okay (okay, okay, okay)<br/>
Just a little pinprick<br/>
There'll be no more, ah<br/>
But you may feel a little sick<br/>
<br/>
Can you stand up?<br/>
I do believe it's working, good<br/>
That'll keep you going through the show<br/>
Come on it's time to go<br/>
There is no pain you are receding<br/>
<br/>
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon<br/>
You are only coming through in waves<br/>
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br/>
When I was a child<br/>
<br/>
I caught a fleeting glimpse<br/>
Out of the corner of my eye<br/>
I turned to look but it was gone<br/>
I cannot put my finger on it now<br/>
<br/>
The child is grown<br/>
The dream is gone<br/>
I have become comfortably numb<br/>
